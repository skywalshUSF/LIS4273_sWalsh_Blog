# The variable assignment2 has a vector with a total of 9 elements
assignment2 <- c(6, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 22, 20, 22)

# Define a function called myMean that will calculate the average
# of a vector. In the body of the function, we are adding all of
# the elements from the assignment2 variable and then dividing by how many
# items are in assignment2
myMean <- function(assignment2) {return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))}

# Run the function, print the mean result into the console.
myMean(assignment2)
