# 'Question A'

# A researcher is interested in the effects of drug against stress reactions. 
# She gives a reaction time test to three different groups of subjects: 
# one group that is under a great deal of stress, one group under a 
# moderate amount of stress, and a third group that is under almost no stress. 
# The subjects of the study were instructed to take the drug test during 
# their next stress episode and to report their stress on a scale of 1 to 10 
# (10 being the most pain).

# Report on drug and stress level by using R. Provide a full summary report 
# on the result of ANOVA testing and what it means.
