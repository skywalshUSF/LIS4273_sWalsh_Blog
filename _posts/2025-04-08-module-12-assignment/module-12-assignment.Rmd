# 'Question A'
# The table below represents charges for a student credit card.

# A1. Construct a time series plot using R.

# Create the data for the charges for a student credit card.
chargeMonths <- c("Jan","Feb","March","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct",
                  "Nov","Dec")
year2012charges <- c(31.9,27,31.3,31,39.4,40.7,42.3,49.5,45,50,50.9,58.5)

year2013charges <- c(39.4,36.2,40.5,44.6,46.8,44.7,52.2,54,48.8,55.8,58.7,63.4)

# Combine the year data
charges <- c(year2012charges, year2013charges)

# Create a time series object for the data
timeSeriesData <- ts(charges, start = c(2012, 1), frequency = 12)
timeSeriesData

# Begin the time series plot to show a time series regression
plot.ts(timeSeriesData)


# A2. Employ the Exponential Smoothing Model as outlined in Avril Voghlan's 
# notes and report the statistical  outcome.

# Apply exponential smoothing using the HoltWinters() function and print the
# required smoothing parameters
holtWintersModel <- HoltWinters(timeSeriesData)
holtWintersModel

# Plot the fitted model in addition to Exponential Smoothing
plot(holtWintersModel, main = "Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing Model")

# Print a summary of the HoltWinters model
summary(holtWintersModel)


# A3. Provide a discussion on the time series and Exponential Smoothing Model 
# result you led to.

# Load the "forecast" library
library(forecast)

# Forecast the next 12 months
forecastHoltWinters <- forecast(holtWintersModel, h = 12)
forecastHoltWinters

# Plot the 12 month forecast
plot(forecastHoltWinters)

# Here is the discussion:

# The time series plot shows a steady increase in student credit card changes
# over almost a three year period. Using the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing
# model, the trend and seasonal components are accurately presented. The model
# fits the data well, as seen in the plot, and the forecast suggests that a
# continued upward trend in charges over the next twelve months will occur.
# This is indicating constant growth that does not change, possibly due to 
# the increased student expenses and even more lengthy economic trends.
