# 'Question A'

# A researcher is interested in the effects of drug against stress reactions. 
# She gives a reaction time test to three different groups of subjects: 
# one group that is under a great deal of stress, one group under a 
# moderate amount of stress, and a third group that is under almost no stress. 
# The subjects of the study were instructed to take the drug test during 
# their next stress episode and to report their stress on a scale of 1 to 10 
# (10 being the most pain).

# Report on drug and stress level by using R. Provide a full summary report 
# on the result of ANOVA testing and what it means.
# More specifically, report the following: 
# Df, Sum, Sq Mean, Sq, F value, Pr(>F)

# Create vectors for each group in stress data table
highStress <- c(10, 9, 8, 9, 10, 8)
moderateStress <- c(8, 10, 6, 7, 8, 8)
lowStress <- c(4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 2)

# Combine the data into a single response variable
stressLevels <- c(highStress, moderateStress, lowStress)

# Create a data frame for the values and stress level factors
stressData <- data.frame(value = c(stressLevels),
stressAmounts = factor(rep(c("High", "Moderate", "Low"), each = 6)))

# ANOVA test
anovaStressResults <- aov(value ~ stressAmounts, data = stressData)

# Create a summary of the results
summary(anovaStressResults)
# Full summary report on the result of ANOVA testing:

# Df for stressAmounts is 2. This stands for k - 1, which is the
# number of samples minus 1, which equals 2.
# Df for the residuals is 15. This is N - k, where N equals the
# number of observations and k equals the number of samples.
# If you add these together, they equal n - 1, total df.

# Sum sq stands for SS(B) + SS(W), where SS(B) = 82.11, which represents
# the sum of squares for between-treatment variance and 
# SS(W) = 28.83, which represents the sum of squares for
# within-treatment variance. Adding SS(B) + SS(W) gives the total variability.

# Mean Sq for stressAmounts is the mean of the sum of squares of the groups 
# that receive the treatment, which equals 41.06, and mean sq for the residuals
# is the mean of the sum of squares of the groups without treatment effects,
# which equals 1.92. Together, they equal the F ratio, MS(B)/MS(W).

# The F value is 21.36. An F value of 1 would indicate no difference between
# the sample means MS(B) and the sample variations MS(W). This large F value
# indicates strong evidence that there is a difference between the group means.

# The Pr(>F) value is 4.08e-05 ***, which is a very low p-value, less than
# 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that there are no differences
# between the means. In this case, we can conclude that there are significant
# differences within the group means.

# 'Question B'

# The zelazo data (taken from the textbook's R package called ISwR) are in 
# the form of a list of vectors, one for each of the four groups.

# B1. Convert the data to a form suitable for the user of lm, and calculate 
# the relevant test. Consider t-tests comparing selected subgroups or 
# obtained by combining groups.

# Load the data set
library(ISwR)
data("zelazo")

# Convert the data to a form suitable for the user
zelazoDf <- data.frame(
zelazoValue = c(zelazo$active, zelazo$passive, zelazo$none, zelazo$ctr.8w),
zelazoTraining = factor(rep(c("Active", "Passive", "None", "Control"),
times = c(length(zelazo$active), length(zelazo$passive), length(zelazo$none),
          length(zelazo$ctr.8w)))))

# Calculate the relevant linear model (lm) test
linearModel <- lm(zelazoDf$zelazoValue~zelazoDf$zelazoTraining,data=zelazoDf)
summary(linearModel)

# Consider t-tests comparing selected subgroups:

# t-test for active training versus no training
activeVersusNone <- t.test(zelazo$active, zelazo$none)
activeVersusNone
# The p-value of 0.09442 is greater than 0.05, so there is no significant
# evidence to reject H0 and there is no difference between the means


# t-test for active training versus passive training
activeVersusPassive <- t.test(zelazo$active, zelazo$passive)
activeVersusPassive
# The p-value of 0.2301 is greater than 0.05, so there is no significant
# evidence to reject H0 and there is no difference between the means

# t-test for active training versus control training
activeVersusControl <- t.test(zelazo$active, zelazo$control)
activeVersusControl
# The p-value 1.238e-05 is less than 0.05, so there is significant evidence
# to reject H0 and a difference does exist between these two groups

# B2. Consider the ANOVA test (one-way or two-way) for this dataset (zelazo)

# Perform the one-way test for this data set using the oneway.test() function
oneway.test(zelazoDf$zelazoValue~zelazoDf$zelazoTraining)
# The oneway.test() function provides information on the F value, the p-value,
# and the df for both the numerator and the denominator.

# Perform the ANOVA test for this data set using the aov() function
zelazoAOV <- aov(zelazoDf$zelazoValue~zelazoDf$zelazoTraining, data=zelazoDf)
summary(zelazoAOV)

# After using the aov() function, I then called the summary() function so that
# I can print a table to get the variations, zelazo training group values, 
# and residual values.
